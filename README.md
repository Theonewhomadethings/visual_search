# Visual Search of an Image Collection

This project involves writing programs to visually search an image collection. This program will accept an image as search query and returns a list of images in the collection ranked according to their similarity. Our output displays only the top 20 images.

We explored different techniques,distance metrics, image descriptors and algorithms for this project.

We explored:
- Global Colour Histograms
- Precision Recall statistics for an evaluation methodology.
- Different Spatial grids for both Colour and Texture.
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Explored different Descriptors and Distance measurements
- Bag of Visual Words retrieval
- Object classification using Support Vector Machines (SVM)
